An Alexa skill for keeping track of the people in the house. 

This the code I've been writing for [my first Alexa skill](https://hackernoon.com/my-first-alexa-custom-skill-6a198d385c84#.mo7tpufsa). 

If you find this useful, please consider buying my LeanPub book [Adventures with Alexa](https://leanpub.com/adventureswithalexa) - you get to choose the price! Both the book and this code are works in progress, but your support encourages me to keep working on them.
